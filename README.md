How to use React-Router-dom 6.4.2 v

This was to get deep understanding of what React-router-dom is all about.
Firtly, i created a File folder components, which all my files or my code entails.
In the App.js i wrote this below:

REFERRENCE TO THE App.js

In the App.css i gave it some styling

REFERRENCE TO App.css

Secondly index.js file i imported react router dom like this in v 6.4.2 

REFERRENCE TO index.js

Thirdly in my App.js i imported My Routes as the parent element and Route as the child element 

REFERRENCE TO App.js file 


Thanks a lot !!!
